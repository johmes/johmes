- 👋 Hi, my name is Johannes
- 💻 2+ years of work in a co-founded start-up and part-time job as a software consultant.
- 👀 I have a desire to create easy-to-use apps and software with clean user interfaces. Sometimes I just like to play around and explore new things.
- 🌱 My strengths are in <b>full-stack web dev</b> and <b>native apps</b> made with <b>React Native & Typescript</b> (basic knowledge of iOS & Android native code). 
On top of that I'm well familiar with <b>Java</b> and <b>Python</b>.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on challenging projects to express myself and to get cool things done! You can view my portfolio from <a href="https://johannesmensalo.com">here</a>
- 📫 You can react me via email at <a href="mailto:johannesmensalo@gmail.com">johannesmensalo@gmail.com</a> Let's talk, if you dare!
